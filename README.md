# Bank-Loan-Report
The project analyzes the bank's loan data to provide an in-depth look at the status of issued loans. The analysis includes key metrics such as the total loan amount, the number of loans issued, trends over time, and loan distributions by various parameters (e.g., loan type, customer demographics, etc.).
